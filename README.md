Hello! :blush:

My name is Riccardo and I'm a Network Engineer. Iâ€™ve been in IT since 2016 and I hold several [Cisco Certifications](https://thetechguy.it/certifications/)!     
I decided to go through network automation when I realized that I was doing the same thing many times per day :boom:         
With network automation you can increase:
- **Reliability**
- **Performance**
- **Security**

Moreover, you can **standardize** your distributed network and **reduce managing costs**!     
I'm a **beginner**, let's grow together! :wink:
